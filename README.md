# Paper_Hermes_2015_CerCortex

README

The code and data in this directory are a supplement to:

Hermes, D., Miller, K.J., Wandell, B.A., Winawer, J. (2014). Stimulus dependence of gamma oscillations in human visual cortex. Cerebral Cortex.

Data can be found on:
https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/25/9/2951/2926112#supplementary-data
Place these data in a ./data/ directory with the code

All code in this repository is written in MATLAB (Mathworks) and, together with the included data, can be used to reproduce the plots from the publication.

The code reproduces the ECoG data panels in the main text of the paper and one panel from the supplement: Main figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Figure S2.

Code and data are provided as part of the goal of ensuring that computational methods are reproducible by other researchers.
